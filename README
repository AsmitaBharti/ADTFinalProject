convert seconds since epoch to a `datetime` object

Current Struggle:
1. choose yahoo financial API(YFA) or yfinancial?(Update!: alpha_vantage(maybe))
YFA have more information about schema, but the timestamp they are using need to convert. Moreover, it has limit.
yfinancial is totally free and don't have any access limit. BUT, the data schema is not obvious.
Temporary using YFA.

2. About data structure:(FIXED)
I guess we should give each company a "table", but currently we are only using one "table" for one company, I decide to go for it and fix it later.

3. Reduce the data duplication caused by add stock price data.

Using aggregation to solve it.(FAIL)
# ERROR: Data Structure Error Find, Need to adjust our data structure(schema)
Maybe we can set date to an unique index to solve it. When we insert new price data, we can set the insert command to skip those are duplicated in data?
